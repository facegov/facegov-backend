This document explains the file and folder structure for a serverless backend project, typically used with AWS Lambda.

== Project Structure

== Detailed Explanation

=== Root Directory

`facegov-backend/`:: The root directory of your backend project.

=== Source Code

`src/`:: Contains all the source code for your project.

==== Functions

`functions/`:: Each subdirectory here represents a separate Lambda function.

===== Individual Functions

`function1/` and `function2/`:: Individual Lambda functions.

.Function Structure
[source]
----
function1/
├── index.js
├── package.json
├── node_modules/
└── tests/
    └── index.test.js
----

* `index.js`: The main file containing the Lambda function code.
* `package.json`: Defines dependencies specific to this function.
* `node_modules/`: Contains installed npm packages for this function.
* `tests/`: Unit tests for this specific function.

==== Shared Code

`lib/`:: Shared code that can be used across multiple Lambda functions.

==== Tests

`tests/`:: Contains integration or end-to-end tests for your entire backend.

=== Configuration Files

`serverless.yml`:: Configuration file for the Serverless Framework. It defines your Lambda functions, API Gateway endpoints, and other AWS resources.

`package.json`:: The main package file for your project. It lists dependencies and scripts for the entire backend.

`.gitignore`:: Specifies files and directories that Git should ignore, like `node_modules/` and environment-specific files.

`README.md`:: Documentation for your project, explaining how to set up, deploy, and use your backend.

== Benefits of This Structure

1. *Separation of Concerns*: Each function is isolated, allowing for independent development and deployment.
2. *Shared Code*: The `lib/` directory allows you to share code between functions, reducing duplication.
3. *Easy Testing*: With a dedicated `tests/` directory for each function and the project as a whole, you can ensure comprehensive test coverage.
4. *Serverless-Ready*: This structure works well with the Serverless Framework, making deployment to AWS Lambda straightforward.
5. *Scalability*: As your project grows, you can easily add more functions without cluttering the project structure.

== Working with This Structure

* Each Lambda function (`function1`, `function2`, etc.) is typically triggered by a specific event (e.g., an API Gateway request, an S3 event).
* The `serverless.yml` file is crucial for defining how these functions are deployed and integrated with other AWS services.
* Shared code in the `lib/` directory can include utilities, database connectors, or any logic used across multiple functions.

This structure is particularly well-suited for microservices architectures and serverless applications, allowing for flexible and scalable backend development.




The Lambda function should be structure as follows:


== User Management

CreateUserHandler: Handle user registration
UpdateUserHandler: Update user profile information
DeleteUserHandler: Handle account deletion

== Post Management

CreatePostHandler: Create new posts
DeletePostHandler: Delete existing posts
ListPostsHandler: Retrieve posts for a user's feed

== Friend Management

SendFriendRequestHandler: Send friend requests
AcceptFriendRequestHandler: Accept incoming friend requests
ListFriendsHandler: Retrieve a user's friend list

== Notification

SendNotificationHandler: Send notifications (e.g., friend requests, likes)
ListNotificationsHandler: Retrieve a user's notifications

== Analytics

TrackUserActivityHandler: Log user actions for analytics
GenerateUserInsightsHandler: Create insights based on user activity

== Content Moderation

ModerateContentHandler: Analyze and flag inappropriate content

== Authentication

AuthenticateUserHandler: Handle user login and token generation

== Search

SearchUsersHandler: Search for users
SearchPostsHandler: Search for posts

NOTE: Each of these functions would be implemented in its respective directory under the functions/ folder.


== Benefits of This Structure
This structure allows for:

Separation of concerns
Easy addition of new features
Shared code reuse
Independent deployment of functions
